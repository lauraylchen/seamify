## About The Project

This project is close to my heart as this project is the idea that I originally pitched at Le Wagon back in February 2022. A few students voted for my project, therefore we were able to develop the web application in 2 weeks.

The application serves to connect local seamstresses with customers through alterations and repairs. The idea is to be community-oriented and contribute to sustainability.

In our user story, the customer searches by selecting the type of clothing, alteration or repair type, the material type along with their postal code. 

The customer gets a list of nearby seamstresses that can perform that type of alteration or repair. Then by visiting the seamstress profile page, the customer can contact that seamstress and place an order.

Having a complete order allows leaving a review about the experience.

This was the 2 weeks final project that I have developed with my team of 3 developers plus myself at Le Wagon Montreal Bootcamp. This application wasn't made responsive. This is a Desktop app view only and made for the Demo Day presentation purposes.

It has been deployed on Heroku.
